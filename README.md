# SleepAddon-BTW-Fabric

This repository uses the [BTW-gradle-fabric-example](https://github.com/BTW-Community/BTW-gradle-fabric-example) repository as a base.

This Addon re-enables the ability to sleep 
by simulating the world at night (inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/BTW-Community/Awoken-Dreams)).

**Fabric is required!**
